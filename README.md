# Yelpcamp-Website
This is first website i have created using Node.js, Express and MongoDb
Its a very simple website, where user can register and upload new campgrounds so that people can view and visit!
We even have ratings for campgrounds
The special feature is campground can be deleted only by user created it,and so is for reviews!
it also has Mapbox to view campground locaions on Map
It not that great but implements all basic works like authentication, authorization, hashing and saving the password of user, uploading images, view locations on Mapboxetc.
